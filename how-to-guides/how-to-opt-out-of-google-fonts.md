# How To Opt-Out of Google Fonts

The GDPR is an important component of EU privacy law and of human rights law, in particular Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.&#x20;

Some countries interpretation of these laws indicate that the use of Google hosted fonts may breach these policies.  We have therefore made the use Google hosted fonts optional for those who want to disable this feature.  You can still use locally hosted Google Fonts inside the product, however the selection is more limited.

1. Go to Settings > Website > Fonts
